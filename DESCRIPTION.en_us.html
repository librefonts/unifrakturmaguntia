  UnifrakturMaguntia is based on Peter Wiegel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s font<a href="http://www.peter-wiegel.de/MainzerFraktur.html">Berthold Mainzer Fraktur</a> which is in turn based on a 1901 typeface by Carl Albert Fahrenwaldt. While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturMaguntia uses smart font technologies for displaying the font&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures &acirc;&euro;&sup1;ch, ck, &Aring;&iquest;t, tz&acirc;&euro;&ordm; that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, &acirc;&euro;&sup1;fi, fl&acirc;&euro;&ordm;) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.

  UnifrakturMaguntia is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license.
